#MySQL/Dreamhost checklist

-In panel.dreamhost.com Go to Goodies->MySQL Databases
-If needed Create a new database and make sure it matches it matches what you wrote in your Django settings. For example, if in your production_settings.py file you have something like this:

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'the_db_name',                         # Or path to database file, if using sqlite3.
        'USER': 'username',                               # Not used in sqlite3.
        'PASSWORD': 'password',                         # Not used in sqlite3.
        'HOST': 'mysql.db.mamss.ca',                    # Set to empty string for localhost. Not used in sqlite3.
        'PORT': '',                                     # Set to empty string for default. Not used in sqlite3.
    }
}

You must match the following items when creating the database:
NAME = Database Name (In Dreamhost)
USER = The user in dreamhost
Password = The user's password in dreamhost
HOST = The Database host name set in dreamhost

-Then you must add the allowed host. If the server is not on the mamss.ca domain but on a remote machine. you may follow these instructions for this https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214883058-How-do-I-connect-to-my-database-using-a-third-party-program-
(Basically, click on the user name of your newly created database and add the machine name or Ip in the Allowable Hosts section)

-You should be able to access the database now
to test, do:
 -manage.py createsuperuser
-Go to the admin section and enter the super user credentials

-If the database is already created, you can connect to it by entering the host name in your browser (i.e mysql.db.mamss.ca). You will be redirected to phpMyadmin page which is a web page dreamhost gives you access to. Enter you dreamhost credentials and you should be able to your database and all the data.
